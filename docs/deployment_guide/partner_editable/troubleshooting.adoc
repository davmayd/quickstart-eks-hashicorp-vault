=== Best practices for using Vault on AWS

The following best practices are enabled by default for this Quick Start:

* Enabled AWS KMS auto-unseal: This uses AWS KMS to store and encrypt Vault's unseal keys. For more information, see
https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/autounseal-aws-kms[Auto-unseal using AWS KMS^].

* Enable cluster HA: This helps to ensure that Vault is set up for fault tolerance. For more information, see https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/raft-storage?in=vault/interactive[Vault HA Cluster with Integrated Storage^].

* Enable Raft storage for HA: This sets up the Raft consensus protocol as Vault's storage backend. For more information, see https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/raft-ha-storage?in=vault/interactive[Use Integrated Storage for HA Coordination^].

* Enable Vault audit to Amazon CloudWatch: This lets you troubleshoot audit logs. For more information, see https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/troubleshooting-vault#enabling-audit-devices[Enabling audit devices^].

* Enable SSL at the Vault UI endpoint: This helps to secure the Vault UI endpoint with an SSL certificate. For more information, see https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/ui[Vault UI^].
